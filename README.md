Noob maker and Python, HTML, CSS, C and JavaScript coder on the block. Hopefully adding the projects that I hope to create over the coming few months, and maybe even years! We will be experimenting with electronics including my Raspberry Pi's, Arduino Uno, Micro:bit and others, writing code predominantly using Python for the Pi and C with the Arduino IDE. I also intend to do some dabling with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 community edition.
